# ðŸš€ Spam Detection System

An intelligent email spam detection system powered by **Logistic Regression**.  
Built as part of a machine learning journey to explore text classification.

##  âœ¨ Features
- Preprocessing of raw email text
- Feature extraction using TF-IDF
- Logistic Regression classifier
- Model evaluation with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“Š Workflow
1. Dataset loaded (`mail_data_1.csv`)
2. Text data cleaned and processed
3. Labels encoded into numerical format
4. TF-IDF used for text representation
5. Logistic Regression applied for classification
6. Performance evaluated with standard metrics

## âš¡ Quickstart

git clone <repo-url>
cd spam-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter notebook spam_dectection.ipynb

# ðŸ“ˆ Results 

Accuracy: >90%

Balanced precision and recall
